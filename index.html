was assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University, served on the Mark I computer programming staff, co-authored three papers on the Mark I, also known as the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator, from 1946- 49 continued to work on the MARK II and MARK III computers under Navy contracts.
In 1949, Hopper joined the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation in Philadelphia as a senior mathematician. also served as UNIVAC director of Automatic Programming Development for Remington Rand.
While working on the UNIVAC I and II, Hopper pioneered the idea of automatic programming and explored new ways to use the computer to code. In 1952 she developed the first compiler called A-0, which translated mathematical code into machine-readable code—an important step toward creating modern programming languages
Hopper is widely recognized for her work designing COBOL, developing compilers for it, and encouraging its broad adoption.

<div class="post-content">
	<h2>Lise Meitner</h2>
<p>
She was born on November 7, 1878, in Vienna, the third child in eight in her Jewish family.

Most famous for: Lise Meitner was a pioneering physicist who studied radioactivity and nuclear physics. She was part of a team that discovered nuclear fission — a term she coined — but she was overlooked in 1945 when her colleague Otto Hahn was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. She has been called the "mother of the atomic bomb," even though she did not directly have anything to do with its development. Element No. 109, meitnerium, was named in her honor.

Other achievements: In 1923, Meitner discovered the radiationless transition. Unfortunately, she didn't receive much credit for the finding. It is called the Auger effect because Pierre Victor Auger, a French scientist, discovered it two years later.
Meitner and Hahn were research partners for around 30 years. During their research, they were one of the first to isolate the isotope protactinium-231, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. 
Education:Because of Austrian restrictions on female education, Meitner wasn't allowed to attend college; however, her family could afford private education, which she completed in 1901. She went on to graduate school at the University of Vienna. Inspired by her teacher, physicist Ludwig Boltzmann, she studied physics and focused her research on radioactivity. She became the second woman to receive a doctorate degree at the university in 1905. Shortly thereafter, physicist Max Planck allowed her to sit in on his lectures — a rare gesture for him; before then, he had rejected any women wanting to attend his lectures. Meitner later became Planck's assistant. She also worked with Hahn, and together they discovered several isotopes. 

Experience: Started 1905 where he graduated from school and retired to England in 1960.

<div class="post-content">
	<h2>Maria Goeppert-Mayer</h2>
	<p>
	She was born on June 28, 1906, in Kattowitz, Upper Silesia, then Germany, the only child of Friedrich Goeppert and his wife Maria, nee Wolff. On her father’s side, she is the seventh straight generation of university professors.

Most famous for:of Physics at theThe German-born American theoretical physicist proposed the nuclear shell model of the atomic nucleus and in 1963 became the second woman to win a Nobel Prize in Physics. Goeppert-Mayer’s mathematical model explained why certain numbers of nucleons (protons and neutrons) in a nucleus result in stable atomic configurations. Her contributions were celebrated by her appointment as full Professor  University of California and her election as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Other achievements: Long before Goeppert-Mayer stood on that stage in Stockholm, however, she had already made some major contributions to physics. While still a graduate student in Gottingen, she predicted the phenomenon of double photon emission. This occurs when two photons are absorbed by a molecule simultaneously, causing the molecule to move to a higher energy state.
When Goeppert-Mayer proposed this, there was no way to actually test it. Her explanation was so clear, however, that all the members of her Ph.D. examining committee, which included the Nobel Laureates Max Born, James Franck, and Adolf Windaus, praised her work.

Education:Education:In the spring of 1924 she enrolled at the University at Göttingen, with the intention of becoming a mathematician. But soon she found herself more attracted to physics. This was the time when quantum mechanics was young and exciting.

Experience:1926 when she started going to a university until 1975 when she died.

	<h2>Ruby Payne-Scott</h2>
	<p>
	She was an Australian pioneer in radiophysics and radio astronomy, and was the first female radio astronomer.


Most famous for:First person to consider the possibility of radio astronomy.The Australian was a pioneer in radio astronomy, the study of celestial objects at radio frequencies, and radiophysics. The first ever female radio astronomer, Payne-Scott was instrumental in making Australia a global leader in radio astronomy in the 1940s. She discovered several types of radiation bursts originating from the sun and played a major role in the first-ever radio astronomical interferometer observation, an important investigative technique in astronomy.

Other achievements:Ruby Payne-Scott had a remarkable career at CSIRO as a radio astronomer where she worked on the development of World War II radar as well as in solar astronomy. In March 1944, she and Joseph Pawsey carried out an initial radio astronomy experiment from the Madsen Building in the grounds of Sydney University. This was followed in 1945 by her carrying out some of the key early solar radio astronomy observations at Dover Heights (Sydney). In the years 1945 to 1947, she discovered three of the five categories of solar bursts originating in the solar corona and made major contributions to the techniques of radio astronomy.

Education:She was then at Sydney Girl’s High School obtaining a leaving certificate in 1928. At the young age of 16, she began Sydney University and graduated in 1933 (course finished in 1932) with First-Class Honours in physics and maths. She was just the third woman to graduate in physics from the University of Sydney. Her MSc in 1936 was in physics, having worked on a medical physics project at the Cancer Research Institute at Sydney University.

Experience: 1933 when she graduated until 1981 when she died.
